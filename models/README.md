Here, you can find the scripts generated by TPOT. Each of them contains a model with the hyperparameter configuration chosen during optimisation.

From the repository's main directory you can run them with: `python models/{scriptname}`. For example `python models/h-maccs-c-nb.py` will train a naive Bayes classifier on MACCS representation and human data.

The naming convention is `{D}-{R}-{T}-{M}.py`:
- `D` - dataset, **h**uman or **r**at
- `R` - representation, **krfp** for Klekota-Roth fingerprint or **maccs** 
- `T` - task, **c**lassification or **r**egression
- `M` - model, **nb** for naive Bayes, **svm** for support vector machines, **trees** for tree models

Provided you use the correct package versions, these scripts should return exactly the same models as those used in the paper. However, the package version mismatch might result in a different random initialisation of models (even though the random seed is set) and in consequence to different final weights.

You can contact us to ask for the pickled models, however, in some cases the files are very large.
